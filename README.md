# Meme Website

This website contains a plethora of memes and was created for fun in Introduction to Computer Science(CIS 005) at Laney College in Summer 2017. It attempts to simulate a fictional company webite with multiple pages linked together in order to allow the user to explore the different parts of the website. Technologies used: HTML and CSS. 
Disclaimer: I do not own any of the images that are on the website.
