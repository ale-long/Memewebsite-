    <p id="howwestarted">It all began when Joshua's creativity went wild one day. He had this amazing idea about a meme company that will go global and engulf the world in memes. His immense pleasure in memes took him beyond his limitations and as a result, he started to create his own website. He eventually recruited more people and his group grew over time. After a year, we gathered enough money from other companies who bought our memes and we expanded our office size. Today, you can see our meme building from afar and it is recognized as one of the greatest buildings in the world. We give all our respect to our founder: Joshua Chan.</p>
